.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rds-ping
is used to test whether a remote node is reachable over RDS.
Its interface is designed to operate pretty much the standard
.Xr ping 8
utility, even though the way it works is pretty different.
.Pp
.Nm rds-ping
opens several RDS sockets and sends packets to port 0 on
the indicated host. This is a special port number to which
no socket is bound; instead, the kernel processes incoming
packets and responds to them.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available for use on the command line:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar count
Causes
.Nm rds-ping
to exit after sending (and receiving) the specified number of
packets.
.It Fl I Ar address
By default,
.Nm rds-ping
will pick the local source address for the RDS socket based
on routing information for the destination address (i.e. if
packets to the given destination would be routed through interface
.Nm ib0 ,
then it will use the IP address of
.Nm ib0
as source address).
Using the
.Fl I
option, you can override this choice.
.It Fl i Ar timeout
By default,
.Nm rds-ping
will wait for one second between sending packets. Use this option
to specified a different interval. The timeout value is given in
seconds, and can be a floating point number. Optionally, append
.Nm msec
or
.Nm usec
to specify a timeout in milliseconds or microseconds, respectively.
.It
Specifying a timeout considerably smaller than the packet round-trip
time will produce unexpected results.
.It Fl x Ar rdma|tcp
By default,
.Nm rds-ping
will use whatever transport is available, giving RDMA priority over
TCP. This option can be used to explicitly select which transport
.Nm rds-ping
should use.
